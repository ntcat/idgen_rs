# ðŸ¦œ idgen_rs
## Introduction
During the time I was writing GoLang, I used [idgen](https://github.com/yitter/idgenerator) , which satisfied my requirements for the Snowflake algorithm ID:

1. Globally unique, using worker_id to achieve distributed uniqueness.
2. Time-ordered, allowing me to extract the time when the ID was generated, which is very important to me.
3. Monotonically increasing, all digits, int64, without sacrificing performance due to string storage.

When I shifted my programming focus entirely to Rust, I naturally wanted to continue using idgen. However, I found that the author was somewhat lazy and used Rust to call a C library, rather than a pure Rust version. I managed to compile it on Linux, though it was troublesome. However, compilation failed on macOS, and I lost patience with it. Therefore, I decided to write a purely Rust version. Of course, it is based on idgen_go to ensure compatibility with this ID generation method.

idgen_rs is implemented based on the Snowflake algorithm and adds some features:

1. Supports multiple calculation methods, including traditional and drift algorithms.
2. Supports custom machine code bit length and sequence number bit length.
3. Supports custom maximum and minimum sequence numbers.
4. Supports custom maximum drift count.
5. Supports custom base time.

fn main() {
    let mut options = IdGeneratorOptions::new(1); // 1 is the worker id
    options.worker_id_bit_length = 10; // Default value is 6, limiting the maximum value of `WorkerId` to 2^6 - 1, meaning up to 64 nodes by default.
    options.seq_bit_length = 6; // Default value is 6, limiting the number of IDs generated per millisecond. If the generation speed exceeds 50,000 IDs per second, consider increasing `SeqBitLength` to 10.
    let base_time: DateTime<Utc> = Utc.with_ymd_and_hms(2023, 3, 13, 3, 3, 3)
        .single()
        .expect("Failed to create DateTime<Utc>");
    options.base_time = base_time.timestamp_millis();

    // Save parameters (this must be called, otherwise the settings will not take effect):
    yit_id_helper::set_id_generator(options);
    // After initialization, wherever an ID is needed, call the following method:
    let new_id = yit_id_helper::next_id();
    println!("new_id: {}", new_id);

    let time = yit_id_helper::extract_time(new_id);
    let datetime: DateTime<Local> = time.into();
    println!("time: {}", datetime.format("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"));
}
